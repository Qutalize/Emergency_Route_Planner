# Emergency_Route_Planner
## Overview
This project was developed as an algorithm assignment using Google Colaboratory.
Given a specified point on a map, the system identifies the nearest fire station and the nearest emergency medical hospital capable of handling critical patients. It then computes and visualizes the shortest route between these locations along with the estimated travel time.
Due to the high computational cost of map rendering, the implementation is limited to a specific area in Kanagawa Prefecture.
